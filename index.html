The response of the CIA to domestic resistance at this time, especially to the Black Power movement, aided in a tactical precedent that has been instrumental in the US military invasions of the 21st century. </p>

          The origins of the weathervane can be traced back to Ancient Greek, when the astronomer Andronikos built a tower topped with a bronze figure of Triton. It became stylish to top pre-Christian Roman villas with figures of gods or demi-gods.<br>
          During the 9th century, roosters became emblematic atop Churches for their reference to Saint Peter. <br>
          Though weathervanes and indicator vials were used before the mid-17th century in the American colonies, as time went on the icon became increasingly popular among the colonists, whose lives were deeply agricultural and sea-faring. However, it also became a symbol of American independence; now every (white) colonist could have a "coat of arms"; divine symbol, atop their house or barn.<br>
          Every American household could be elevated to an authoritative status, and importantly, had claim over the land that they oversaw.
